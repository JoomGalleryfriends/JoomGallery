## Contribute code

Just like the CMS Joomla!, the gallery component JoomGallery is an Open Source project and exists because of its community. Which means that everything in the project is developed and maintained by users of the JoomGallery.
Therefore we ask you to use your skills and knowledge to contribute to the project. Here on GitHub you can help coding and developing the extension.

Following the JoomGalleries coding documentation:

- [Release-Strategy](docs/Releasestrategy.md)
- [Codestyle guide for PHP](docs/Codestyleguide.md)
- [Contribution guide](/docs/Contribution.md)

### Setup development environment
https://docs.joomla.org/Setting_up_your_workstation_for_Joomla_development

**Webserver recommendation:**
- https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/ (Windows only)
- https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html (Windows, Linux and macOS)

**IDE/Editor recommendation:**
- https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/ (Windows, Linux and macOS)
- https://code.visualstudio.com/ (Windows, Linux and macOS)

**Git-Client recommendation:**
- https://desktop.github.com/ (Windows and macOS)

**Recommendet approach for proper versioning with Git:**
1. Checkout the repo into a folder of your choice
2. Download the source code of the dev-branch as zip file and install it on Joomla
3. Remove the installed component folders within your Joomla installation
   - administrator/components/com_joomgallery
   - components/com_joomgallery
   - media/com_joomgallery
   - plugins/finder/joomgallerycategories
   - plugins/finder/joomgalleryimages
   - plugins/privacy/joomgalleryimages
   - plugins/webservices/joomgallery
4. Create symbolic links from those folders to the corresponding folders within the checked out copy of the repository
5. The referenced copy of your component can be properly versioned using Git

## Testing

Testing is an integrate part of the development process and can be done even without coding skills. Just look at the tab `Pull requests` to see which code changes need testing. If you want to test a code change, this is how to do it:

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9" control="controls"><source src="https://www.joomgalleryfriends.net/images/videos/install-a-pr.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag</video>

1. Open the Pull request (PR) you want to test
2. Scroll down the comments feed of the PR all the way to the bottom
3. Open the accordion **All checks have passed**
4. Open the link **PR Build Artifact / build-pr-zip**
5. Change on the left navigation to **Summary**
6. Click the link in the **Artifacts** section which has the name "JoomGallery-PRname"
7. A zip file of the PR gets created and downloaded
8. Install the zip file in your Joomla!
9. Perform tests where the PR changes anything
10. If you find a bug or unexpected behaviour, post a comment in the pull request with the following content:

### Issue reporting
